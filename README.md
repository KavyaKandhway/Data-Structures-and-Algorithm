# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm

## Graph
1. BFS
2. DFS
3. Cycle Detection in undirected graph (DFS and BFS)
4. Cycle Detection in undirected graph using disjoint set and union
5. Cycle detection in directed graph (DFS and BFS(Kahn's algo))
6. Topological Sort (DFS BFS(Kahn's Algo))
7. Dijkstra (minimum distance of all vertices from source)
8. Kruskals algorithm (find minimum spanning tree)
9. Prims (mst)
10. Bellman Ford (min distance from source if -ve egdes are present and also to detect -ve weighted cycle)
11. Floyd Warshal(min distance b/w every pair of vertices) 
12. articulation point
13. bridges in a graph
14. Kosaraju's Algo(Find strongly connected component in directed graph)

## Binary Tree
Inorder, preorder and post order iterative and recursive traversals

## Segment tree Fenwik Tree
